The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts  the number of medals that  each country  will win in a particular olympics  event. This is done by making use of a LinearRegression Model and a Neural network  model. We also evaluate the perfomances of the two models, and compare them with one another.
The data is contained  from the file Teams.csv and the LinearRegression  and neural network models are on the Medal_predictor.ipyng  and  the Neural_Olympics.ipyng files respectively.
